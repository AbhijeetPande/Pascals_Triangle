# Pascals_Triangle

Thank you for checking out my pascal triangle calculator ! This program can print pascals triangle using recursion or non - recursion.
The value up to which the pascal's triangle is printed is currently hard - coded into the code, So to change it, One will have to 
update the code itself, which means its not very user - friendly, but I am working on making it more easily accessible !
